# - BODY:pattern     - Match response body content (e.g., BODY:error, BODY:(?i)php)
# - HEADER:name:val   - Match response header (e.g., HEADER:server:apache, HEADER:content-type:)
# - COOKIE:name:val   - Match response cookie (e.g., COOKIE:sessionid:abc123, COOKIE:auth:)
# - !                - Negation (e.g., !CODE:404, !BODY:error, !COOKIE:sessionid:)
# - &&               - AND logic between conditions

# - "CODE:200|500&&HEADER:server:apache"    - 200 or 500 status AND Apache server header
# - "BODY:(?i)php&&!BODY:error"             - Case-insensitive "php" in body AND no "error"
# - "CODE:200&&COOKIE:sessionid:.*"          - 200 status AND sessionid cookie matches pattern
